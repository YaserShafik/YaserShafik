# Hi there! 👋

## General Description
Hey, I’m a backend developer from Spain with one clear mission: to add value. Moving to New York wasn’t just about a change of scenery—it was about being where the best ideas take shape. 

I chose New York because it's the heart of the startup world, where innovation is constant, and where the potential for growth is limitless. I thrive in environments that challenge me, and there’s no better place than here to learn from the best and contribute to building something that lasts.
